LogoRecognition
===============

This project is to recognize brand logos in uploaded photos within Flickr accounts and leverage them for advertising. <br>
<br>
This project has 4 parts: <br>
1) A Python module based on Flickr API to regularly pull photo stream from Flickr account. <br>
2) A C++ module based on OpenCV to recognize brand logo in the photos. <br>
3) A Chrome extension to substitute ads on Yahoo News portal if there is brand logo recognized in the photos. <br>
4) A web server directory which contains status endpoints on which the Chrome extention depends. <br>
<br>
This is a hack project to simply demonstrate the idea. <br>
